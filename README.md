## What makes Shinkō different?

**No XP exploits.** Complete a habit once per day, earn XP once. Uncheck it, lose the XP. Simple, honest progress.

**Real streaks.** Your 30-day streak means 30 consecutive days, not 30 random completions.

**Mystery chests.** Complete all your daily habits to unlock bonus rewards. Miss one? No chest.

## The experience

- **Daily quests** that adapt to your habits
- **Streak freezes** for when life happens  
- **Japanese-inspired dark UI** with smooth animations
- **Local-first** with JSON export/import
- **Cross-platform** — Android, iOS, Web, Desktop

## Get started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zanderooo/shinko.git
cd shinko
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

*Requires Flutter ≥3.9.0*

## Philosophy

Progress isn't about perfection. It's about showing up, day after day, and celebrating the small wins that compound into something meaningful.

Shinkō makes that journey feel good.
